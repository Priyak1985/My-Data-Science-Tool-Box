<h1> Explainer</h1>

This is a one stop destination for me to access all the handy data science driven tools that I often use to curate the data and then apply some predictive model to it.It is an exhaustive list of code blocks I have written or collected from online sources. I use them solve for my data science use cases. 

Each block is in the form of an independent function call. Ideally the entire python file should be imported in the main code and the functions accessed as per the case. Not all may be required to be used in a single use case. But these are very frequently used transformations. The requirement text file lists out the necessary python packages that must be installed to use these functions.

The python notebook(s) should explain furthr.
